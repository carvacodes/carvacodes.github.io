# Canvas Composite Operations

A quick look at the various composite operations provided to us by the CanvasRenderingContext2D interface.

Click on the page to form a new curl, or check out the other animations using the **Animation** tab in the GUI. Check out https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/globalCompositeOperation for the complete CanvasRenderingContext2D reference.

This demo also uses the [dat.GUI](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui) controller library for its graphical user interface.
